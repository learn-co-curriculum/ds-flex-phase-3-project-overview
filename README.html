<h2>ðŸŽ¯FLEX Phase 3 Project Overview</h2>
<p>After completing Topics 21-32, you should be all set to tackle the Phase 3 Project! [<a href="">Assignment Link ðŸ”— </a>]</p>
<p>The Phase 2 Project is your first classification project, where you will build and tune machine learning classification models to answer stakeholder questions and provide additional insights.</p>
<p>Overall the project should take 20-40 hours to complete. To stay on pace, you should aim to complete the project in the following # of weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>20-week pace: 1 week</li>
<li>40-week pace: 2 weeks</li>
<li>60-week pace: 3-4 weeks</li>
</ul>
<p>Your assigned One-on-One lead can help you find out exactly how many days you should spend on your end-of-phase project using the Flex Cadence and Milestones Calendar - please ask if you need help planning your project time!</p>
<p>At the end of the project, you will have a live Project Review session <em><strong>with an instructor who is not your One-on-One Lead!</strong></em> Passing that review is how you progress to the next Phase, and you are required to pass all Phase Project Reviews in numerical order to complete the course.</p>
<h2>Project Requirements</h2>
<p>The project requirements are spelled out in both:</p>
<ol>
<li>the rubric attached to the Phase 3 Project [<a href="">Assignment Link ðŸ”— </a>]</li>

</ol>
<p>In brief, the major 3 deliverables include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A jupyter notebook with your technical analysis</li>
<li>A 5-10 minute non-technical executive summary presentation</li>
<li>A GitHub repository that contains:
<ul>
<li>the .ipynb notebook file</li>
<li>the .pdf of your presentation</li>
<li>a README summarizing your results</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Getting Started:</h2>
<p>When you're ready to begin the project, we recommend you do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Message your One-on-One Lead on Slack and indicate you've begun the project.
<ul>
<li><strong>If you are going to choose your own dataset, you must get it approved by your instructor!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Check the Phase 3 Project Assignment for the requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create your GitHub repository where you can save all of your work</li>
<li>Schedule a Project Review sessionÂ <em><strong>with an instructor other than your One-on-One Lead</strong></em>
<ul>
<li>Note: you are <strong>allowed to continue to refine and update your project/repo up until 24 hours before your review,</strong> at which point the submitted materials will be considered final.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Submitting Your Project on Canvas</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will turn in your project materials on 2 Canvas assignments:
<ul>
<li>The GitHub Repo Link is uploaded here:
<ul>
<li>[Phase 3 Project - GitHub Repository URLðŸ”— ](&quot;Phase 2 Project - GitHub Repository URL&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The PDF Exports of Your Notebook, Presentation, and README are uploaded here:
<ul>
<li>[Phase 3 Project AssignmentðŸ”— ](&quot;Phase 2 Project&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For additional instructions on submitting your project pdfs on canvas see:
<ul>
<li>[Project Submission &amp; Review (Online)ðŸ”— ](&quot;Project Submission &amp; Review (Online)&quot;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scheduling Your Review</h3>
<p>Schedule your review using the Phase 2 Project Booking Page <a href="https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase2ProjectReviews">(https://go.oncehub.com/ODSPhase3ProjectReviews)</a></p>
<ol>
<li>First, confirm your auto-detected time zone and then select Continue</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/ds-flex-phase-3-project-overview/main/images/scheduling-example-1.png" alt="Confirm your time zone.">
2. Then, on the calendar that appears, select a timeslot from the calendar</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/ds-flex-phase-3-project-overview/main/images/scheduling-example-2.png" alt="Select a timeslot"></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>After selecting a time slot you should see a form requesting information about you and your project materials.Â <strong>Please note the third line of the form, which indicates the Team Member that your appointment will be with. If the selected timeslot is with your assigned One-on-One Lead, then please select another timeslot.</strong>
<strong><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/ds-flex-phase-3-project-overview/main/images/scheduling-example-3.png" alt="Project scheduling form - check the Team Member field"></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Note: you are allowed to <strong>continue to refine and update your project/repo up until 24 hours before your review</strong>, at which point the submitted materials will be considered final.</p>
<h2>Project Review Format</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, you will talk through your <strong>5-8 minute, non-technical presentation</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The reviewing instructor will ask you a question or two as if they were your target audience</li>
<li>The reviewing instructor will then discuss any feedback or action items for the presentation</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Next, you will go through your <strong>technical notebook</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Please have the notebook open and pre-run before your review.</li>
<li>Depending on which project it is, the reviewing instructor will focus on a few areas of the notebook and generally will NOT have you talk through 100% of it</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After reviewing the notebook and presentation, the reviewing instructor will submit feedback based on the rubric in Canvas (with the changes requested, if relevant)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>With all that in mind - go forth and create the first big ticket item for your data science portfolio, we can't wait to see it!</p>
